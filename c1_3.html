<p style= "font-family verdana"> A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations  automatically.</p>
<p style=font-family papyrus"> The first computers were used primarily for numerical calculations. However, as any information can be numerically encoded, people 
soon realized that computers are capable of general-purpose information processing. Their capacity to handle large amounts of data has extended the range and accuracy of weather
 forecasting.<b> Their speed has allowed them to make decisions about routing telephone connections through a network and to control mechanical systems such as automobiles, nuclear
 reactors, and robotic surgical tools</b> They are also cheap enough to be embedded in everyday appliances and to make clothes dryers and rice cookers “smart.” Computers have 
 allowed us to pose and answer questions that could not be pursued before. <i>These questions might be about DNA sequences in genes, patterns of activity in a consumer market, 
 or all the uses of a word in texts that have been stored in a database. Increasingly, computers can also learn and adapt as they operate</i>.
